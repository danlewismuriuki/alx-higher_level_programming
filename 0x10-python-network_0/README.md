Introduction
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive overview of essential concepts related to the web, making it accessible for beginners.

URL
A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on the internet. It typically consists of several components, including the scheme, domain name, path, query string, and fragment identifier.

HTTP
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML files, over the internet. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

Reading a URL
Understanding how to read a URL involves breaking down its components, such as the scheme, domain name, path, query string, and fragment identifier, to grasp its structure and purpose.

HTTP URL Scheme
The scheme for an HTTP URL indicates the protocol used for accessing the resource. Common schemes include "http" and "https," which denote unencrypted and encrypted HTTP connections, respectively.

Domain Name
A domain name is a human-readable label assigned to a specific IP address on the internet. It serves as a memorable identifier for websites and other online services.

Sub-Domain
A sub-domain is a subset of a larger domain, often used to organize or differentiate content within a website. For example, "blog.example.com" is a sub-domain of "example.com."

Port Number in a URL
Port numbers in URLs specify the communication endpoint for accessing web resources. They are typically included after the domain name or IP address, separated by a colon.

Query String
A query string is a part of a URL that contains data to be passed to the server as parameters. It consists of key-value pairs separated by "&" symbols and is commonly used in HTTP GET requests.

HTTP Request
An HTTP request is a message sent by a client to a server, typically to request the retrieval or modification of a resource. It consists of a request line, headers, and an optional message body.

HTTP Response
An HTTP response is a message sent by a server to a client in response to an HTTP request. It contains status information, headers, and an optional message body.

HTTP Headers
HTTP headers are additional pieces of information included in HTTP requests and responses to provide metadata about the communication between the client and server.

HTTP Message Body
The HTTP message body contains the payload data transmitted between the client and server in an HTTP request or response. It can include various types of content, such as text, HTML, JSON, or binary data.

HTTP Request Method
An HTTP request method defines the action to be performed on a resource identified by a URL. Common methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more, each serving a specific purpose.

HTTP Response Status Code
An HTTP response status code indicates the outcome of an HTTP request. Status codes are three-digit integers grouped into five categories, with each category representing a specific type of response.

HTTP Cookie
An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data sent from a web server and stored on the client's browser. It is commonly used for session management, user authentication, and tracking user behavior.

Making a Request with cURL
cURL is a command-line tool for transferring data using various network protocols, including HTTP. It allows users to make HTTP requests directly from the terminal, providing flexibility and control over the process.

Browser Behavior: Typing google.com
When a user types "google.com" into their browser's address bar, the browser initiates an HTTP request to the Google servers, requesting the homepage. Upon receiving the response, the browser renders the webpage, allowing the user to interact with the search engine.
