# 0x06 Python Classes

This directory contains Python scripts and exercises related to classes and object-oriented programming (OOP). The scripts cover various concepts, including class creation, instance methods, special methods, and more.

## Scripts

1. **0-square.py**: An empty class `Square` that defines a square.

2. **1-square.py**: A class `Square` that defines a square with a private attribute `size`.

3. **2-square.py**: Enhances the `Square` class by adding getter and setter methods for the `size` attribute.

4. **3-square.py**: Adds an instance method `area` to the `Square` class to calculate the area of the square.

5. **4-square.py**: Adds a property `size` to the `Square` class for getting and setting the size of the square.

6. **5-square.py**: Adds a public instance method `my_print` to the `Square` class for printing the square using the `#` character.

7. **6-square.py**: Extends the `Square` class to support position offset when printing.

8. **100-singly_linked_list.py**: Defines a Node and SinglyLinkedList class for a simple linked list.

9. **101-square.py**: Implements a `Square` class with comparison operators.

## Usage

Each script can be run individually. For example:

```bash
$ python 0-square.py
