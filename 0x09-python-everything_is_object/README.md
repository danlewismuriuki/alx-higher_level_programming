## Exploring Python's Object-Oriented Nature

This directory delves into the fundamental concept that "everything is an object" in Python, a cornerstone of its object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. Dive into the exercises and materials to solidify your grasp of OOP principles and their practical applications in Python.

### Key Concepts Covered

- **Objects as the building blocks:** Understand how everything in Python, from numbers to functions, is an object with attributes and methods.
- **Classes as blueprints for objects:** Learn how to create classes to model real-world entities and define their behavior.
- **Instance creation and manipulation:** Explore how to instantiate objects from classes and interact with their attributes and methods.
- **Inheritance and polymorphism:** Discover how to create hierarchical relationships between classes, enabling code reuse and flexibility.
- **Introspection tools:** Utilize Python's built-in functions like `type()`, `dir()`, and `isinstance()` to examine objects and their relationships.

### Contents

- **0-answer.txt:** Contains answers to specific exercises or prompts related to object-oriented concepts in Python.
- **[additional_files.py](link_to_additional_files):** (If applicable) Contains supplementary Python scripts or modules used within this directory.
