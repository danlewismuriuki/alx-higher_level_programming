# JavaScript Objects, Scopes, and Closures

This directory contains JavaScript files related to objects, scopes, and closures in JavaScript.

## Description

JavaScript is a versatile language that supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts through objects, scopes, and closures. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable JavaScript code.

This directory includes exercises and examples covering the following topics:

- Creating and manipulating JavaScript objects
- Understanding variable scopes in JavaScript
- Working with closures and their applications

## Files

- `1-object_inside_object.js`: Example of nesting objects within JavaScript objects.
- `2-concat_me.js`: Script that concatenates two arguments passed to it.
- `3-classrooms.js`: Script that defines a dictionary of classroom objects.
- `4-let_me_const.js`: Script that modifies the value of a variable using `let` and `const`.
- `5-to_object.js`: Function that converts an array to an object.
- `6-adv_dictionary.js`: Script that defines an advanced dictionary of classroom objects.
- `7-occurrences.js`: Function that returns the number of occurrences of an element in a list.
- `8-esrever.js`: Function that reverses a list.
- `9-logme.js`: Function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.
- `10-converter.js`: Script that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument.
- `100-map.js`: Script that imports an array and computes a new array.
- `101-sorted.js`: Script that imports a dictionary of occurrences and computes a new dictionary of occurrences by user ID.
- `102-concat_arrays.js`: Function that concatenates two arrays.
- `103-search.js`: Function that searches for an occurrence in a list.
- `104-ready.js`: Script that imports a dictionary of occurrences and computes a new dictionary of occurrences by user ID.

## Usage

To run these scripts, you can use Node.js. For example:

```bash
node 1-object_inside_object.js
