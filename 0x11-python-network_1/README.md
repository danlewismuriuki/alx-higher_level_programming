Python Network Resource Retrieval Guide
This guide provides instructions on how to perform various tasks related to fetching internet resources, decoding responses, and manipulating data using Python packages like urllib and requests.

Topics Covered
Fetching internet resources with the Python package urllib
Decoding urllib body responses
Using the Python package requests (requests is way simpler than urllib)
Making HTTP GET requests
Making HTTP POST/PUT/etc. requests
Fetching JSON resources
Manipulating data from an external service
Instructions
Fetching Internet Resources with urllib
To fetch internet resources using urllib, follow these steps:

python
Copy code
import urllib.request

# Make a GET request
with urllib.request.urlopen('http://example.com') as response:
    html = response.read().decode('utf-8')
    print(html)
Decoding urllib Body Response
You can decode the body response using the .decode() method, as shown in the example above.

Using the Python package requests
To use the requests package for making HTTP requests:

python
Copy code
import requests

# Make a GET request
response = requests.get('http://example.com')
html = response.text
print(html)
Making HTTP GET Request
You can make a GET request using both urllib and requests, as shown in the examples above.

Making HTTP POST/PUT/etc. Request
python
Copy code
# Using requests
data = {'key': 'value'}
response = requests.post('http://example.com/post', data=data)

# Using urllib
import urllib.parse
import urllib.request

data = urllib.parse.urlencode({'key': 'value'})
data = data.encode('utf-8')  # data should be bytes
req = urllib.request.Request('http://example.com/post', data)
with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as response:
    print(response.read().decode('utf-8'))
Fetching JSON Resources
python
Copy code
# Using requests
response = requests.get('http://example.com/data.json')
data = response.json()

# Using urllib
import json
with urllib.request.urlopen('http://example.com/data.json') as response:
    data = json.load(response)
Manipulating Data from an External Service
Once you have fetched the data, you can manipulate it using standard Python data manipulation techniques, such as iterating over lists/dictionaries, filtering, sorting, etc.
